· Rice: This creamy rice pudding recipe starts with white rice cooked until tender. <br>
· Milk: You'll need two cups of milk, divided. <br>
· Sugar: The rice pudding is sweetened with white sugar. <br>
· Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavor of the other ingredients, but it won't make the pudding taste salty. <br>
· Egg: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the pudding together. <br>
· Raisins: Raisins lend bursts of fruity flavor. <br>
· Butter: Butter adds even more moisture and richness. <br>
· Vanilla: A dash of vanilla enhances the overall flavor of the rice pudding.
